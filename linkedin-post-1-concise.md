**🚀 Introducing Vibe Computing — Manage Your Entire Server Fleet with Natural Language**

Tired of juggling multiple cloud consoles, SSH sessions, and CLI commands?

We built something different. Just type what you want:
→ "Check disk space on all production servers"
→ "Install nginx on the new machines"
→ "Show me AWS costs for this month"

AI figures out the commands. You stay in control.

✅ Cloud VMs, on-prem servers, bare metal — one interface
✅ Works with AWS, GCP, Azure, Hetzner, DigitalOcean
✅ Linux support now, Windows coming soon
✅ Self-hosted option for air-gapped environments

**Beta is now open — but only until January 7th.**
