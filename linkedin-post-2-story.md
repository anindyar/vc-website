# LinkedIn Post - Story-driven (Better for Organic Reach)

**Vibe coding let us build apps by just describing them.**

Why are we still managing servers like it's 2010?

- SSH into machines one by one
- Memorize CLI flags and cloud console layouts
- Copy-paste commands from Stack Overflow
- Pray that production doesn't break

Vibe coding proved we don't need to type every character ourselves. AI understands intent.

So we asked: what if infrastructure worked the same way?

**Introducing Vibe Computing.**

"Restart all containers that crashed in the last hour"
→ Done across 47 servers.

"Spin up 3 new instances and add them to the load balancer"
→ Provisioned and configured.

"What's causing high CPU on the payment service?"
→ AI investigates and explains.

One console. Your entire fleet. Cloud VMs, on-prem racks, bare metal machines — all managed through natural language.

We're not replacing DevOps engineers. We're giving them superpowers.

**Beta opens January 1st, 2026. Closes January 7th.**

If vibe coding changed how you build, vibe computing will change how you operate.
